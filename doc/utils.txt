TESTING BACK FUNCTIONS

- database is seeded and updated
- server is launched
- do [make log-back]
- if no compilation errors:
    - get valid token in the log-back (logger.log in auth.service.signin42)
    - now, on Insomnia, put it into [authorization] + [bearer [token]]
    - put tested route, such as http://172.17.0.1:5500/[src_name]/[function_name]
    - send and check log-back
