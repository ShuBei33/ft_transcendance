HOW TO CREATE BACK FUNCTIONS

1. Launch containers with the .env:
	- make enter-back
	- open a new terminal, make log-back

[NOW IN ENTER-BACK]
2. Create database, if not already created:
	- see prisma/README.md
	- if you already have a migration
		-> fill your database with seed (npx prisma db seed)
		-> launch prisma studio

3. Write your functions:
	- do you need a DTO?
		-> is there a form?
	- modify controller
		-> simplify it to use error and success utils 
		-> you should only return the service in your controller
	- code your service
		-> import what you need
		-> create your service class, ex: class FriendshipService
		-> add the constructor
		-> start coding the utils functions! (get, create, remove, etc)

4. Body of your utils functions:
	- try
		-> display / create / delete what you need /HEART OF YOUR CODE\
		-> return what you need
	- catch
		-> return error

5. Testing your function
	- go to Insomnia
		-> get a valid token at http://172.17.0.1:5500/auth/signin42
		-> put it in Authorization  | Bearer  [token]
		-> choose your type ([POST/GET etc]) and add your route: http://172.17.0.1:5500/[src_name]/[function_name]
		-> check output in log-back and insomnia
